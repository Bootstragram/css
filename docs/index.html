        Normally, <a href="#">both your asses</a> would be dead as fucking fried
        chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional
        period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you
        this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too
        much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
        the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name
        of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
        darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
        children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
        furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
        And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called
        a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on
        the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
        shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
        don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became
        nothing.
